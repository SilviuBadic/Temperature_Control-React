# Temperature Control - React
This is one of my first projects using REACT. It's a simple application built with HTML, a bit of JavaScript and REACT. The interface allows users to decrease or increase the temperature, and dynamically updating the text displayed in the center, and also the background color to reflect the current temperature.

## Features
- Interactive buttons to increase or decrease the temperature 
- Background color chances dynamically based on user's choices.
- Feedback provided dynamically if a certain degree is reached.

## Lessons Learned
First of all, DOM Manipulation, event handling and dynamic styling are some lessons learned while creating this app. Also the use of State.
## Optimizations

It was pretty simple app in which I've practiced a bit about the things I've spoken earlier.

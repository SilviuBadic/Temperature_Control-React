# Temperature Control - React
This is one of my first projects using REACT. It's a simple application built with HTML, a bit of JavaScript and REACT. The interface allows users to decrease or increase the temperature, and dynamically updating the text displayed in the center, and also the background color to reflect the current temperature.

## Features
- Interactive buttons to increase or decrease the temperature 
- One interactive button which let us send the text to our list;
- Two interactive buttons which let us delete or mark the row as checked.

## Lessons Learned

The main lesson was to understand how a component and JSX work, how to work with events in React, to call a function when a specific button is clicked, as well as organizing the components and applying the UseState hooks. 

I've learned how props work and how to implement them in our code.
## Optimizations

It was a good starting point to understand some of the main concepts of REACT, to make my application more composable, by combining a few parts and make a whole.
